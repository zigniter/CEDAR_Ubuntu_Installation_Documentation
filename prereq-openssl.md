# OpenSSL

You most probably already have `openssl` on your system. If not, please install it using:

```sh
sudo apt install openssl
```
## Verify OpenSSL

After the installation, please verify the version in a shell: 
```sh
openssl version -d
```

You should see something similar:
```
OPENSSLDIR: "/usr/local/ssl"
```
