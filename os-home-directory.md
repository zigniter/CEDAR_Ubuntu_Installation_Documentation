# CEDAR Home Directory

You will need a directory where all the CEDAR-related code, configuration, log files and some executable will reside.
You should create a directory under your home directory:

```sh
mkdir ~/CEDAR 
```

???+ warning "Important"

    Of course, you can choose to have this CEDAR home directory in a different place.
    We have an environment variable (set up later during this guide as `CEDAR_HOME`) which holds this path.
    
    We suggest, however, that your CEDAR home directory path does not contain spaces or special characters.

    If you see this path referenced directly in this guide (as in `~/CEDAR`) and you did not use the same path, please replace it with the proper value on your system.
