# Usernames and Passwords

Throughout this guide we use some default usernames and passwords.

The usernames reflect the system name they are associated with and their usage intent (e.g. `cedarMongoUser` is CEDAR app level user for MongoDB access).

The passwords for all the users are set to `changeme`.

You are welcome to change the usernames and/or passwords, but please make note of them.
You will need them to properly configure the environment variables that govern the CEDAR configuration.
