# CEDAR Domain

This guide assumes that the installation will be available at `cedar.metadatacenter.orgx`.
Please note the `x` at the end of `orgx`.
This way the development environment will be close to the final production environment even in the domain names.

???+ warning "Important"
    
    We encourage you to follow this naming convention. The domain name appears in several places in this guide.
    
    Of course, if you prefer, you can set up your environment for a different domain.
    
    In that case, please make sure that you replace the domain name/names in every command and every file that references it.
