# Overview

Nginx acts as a reverse proxy in front of all CEDAR microservices, frontends, and Keycloak.
The Nginx default port may conflict with other server such as apache2. Make sure you modify apache2 port 80 or stop it. 
As such, each request to CEDAR arrives to `nginx` on the standard `443` `https` port.
Based on the subdomain in the request, `nginx` will forward the request to one of the components.
`Nginx` talks on plain `http` with all the microservices and the frontends.
`Nginx` connects to `Keycloak` using `https`.

## List of services behind `nginx`
This table summarizes the services that are proxied by `nginx`.
The microservices are ordered in increasing `port` number order, which shows the evolution of CEDAR.

The frontend is delivered differently during development than on production.
